1) Meditation quest: If the chosen time is 5 minutes, the app will only run the feature for roughly 2 minutes and then 
skip over to the "quest completed" page and will display the message "Something went wrong, please try again later."

2) Meditation quest: If the chosen time is 3 minutes, the app will only run the feature for roughly 1 minute and then 
skip over to the "quest completed" page and will display the message "Something went wrong, please try again later."

3) Mindfulness Breathing: If 5 breaths is chosen, the app will only prompt the user to take 2 breaths. This is not an issue
when 10 or 15 breaths are selected.

4) Mindfulness Breathing: Repeatedly tapping on the button the user is supposed to hold on to as they breathe in will cause
the audio to cut out.

5) The settings (gear) button is unresponsive on all pages that it appears on.

6) The app will not allow the user to "swipe" out of the community page, only letting the user access other pages of the app
with the bottom row of buttons. This is not an issue on any other pages.
